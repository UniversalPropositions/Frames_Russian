# Frames_Russian

This repository contains Russian frames files automatically generated during the projection process.


These frames files are generated on top of base **EN PropBank version 3.0**. 

### Known issues
- These frame files are automatically generated and may contain some mistakes. Let us know if you find any issues with these files by opening git issues in this repository.
- These frame files haven't run through a native speaker for content correctness. So expect some inconsistencies.
	+ If you like to help improve these frame files, please let us know by writing a git issue [here](https://github.com/UniversalPropositions/docs/issues/new).
- We are aware that some of the frame lemmas are not correct. It is because of the parser we used to generate these files. This is planned to be fixed in the next UP release. 


### Folder structure

- **html_frames**
	+ All frame files are in `html` format
- **xml_frames** [WIP]
	+ All frames are in `xml` format.
